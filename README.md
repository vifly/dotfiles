# dotfiles

My dotfiles controlled by GNU stow following [this way](https://farseerfc.me/using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html).

## Notes
### Zsh
After clone this repository, don't forget to run:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

To use zsh-histdb, sqlite is required.  
And I recommend installing the following software:

```
sudo pacman -S bat prettyping exa fd ripgrep
```
